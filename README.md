<h1>Vulnerability Management with Nessus Essentials</h1>
This tutorial outlines the use of Nessus Essentials to scan a Windows 10 VM with old, deprecated software. Following the scan we will remediate a few issues by uninstalling / updating certain pieces of software and then re-scan the system to see the results. <br />


<h2>Environments and Technologies Used</h2>

- VMware with Windows 10 VM
- Nessus Essentials

<h2>Operating Systems Used </h2>

- Windows 10</b> (21H2)


<h2>Launch VM and Check connectivity</h2>


<p>
I initiated the project by setting up a new VM running Windows 10. Once running I pinged the VM from my local machine to check connectivity. I was getting timeouts due to our VM's firewall settings.

</p>
To workaround this for now I will turn off the firewall. Pinging after this works, so we are good to go.

Now we will begin the process of scanning for vulnerabilities. I log into the Tenable Nessus webapp and initially run just a basic network scan. I point the target to the IP of my windows VM and run this first scan with NO CREDENTIALS. This is an important destinction to make since a credentialed scan will be a more detailed scan.

<p>
The scan completes and gives us a series of vulnerabilities, each ranked by severity. In this initial un-credentialed scan I had 17 total vulnerabilities on my VM, mostly registering as medium - low impact. From here I can click into the vulnerabilities and get more info on them including: Descriptions, Solutions. and additional informative links.

<p>
Next up I ran a credentialed scan. The difference here is I added the username / password which will create a more thorough scan. You can see right away Nessus found more vulnerabilities, 42 total, whereas the initial basic scan was 17.
