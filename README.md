<h1>Vulnerability Management with Nessus Essentials</h1>
This tutorial outlines the use of Nessus Essentials to scan a Windows 10 VM with old, deprecated software. Following the scan we will remediate a few issues by uninstalling / updating certain pieces of software and then re-scan the system to see the results. <br />


<h2>Environments and Technologies Used</h2>

- VMware 
- Nessus Essentials

<h2>Operating Systems Used </h2>

- Windows 10</b> (21H2)


<h2>Launch VM and Check connectivity</h2>


<p>
I initiated the project by setting up a new VM running Windows 10. Once running I pinged the VM from my local machine to check connectivity. I was getting timeouts due to our VM's firewall settings.

</p>
To workaround this for now I will turn off the firewall. Pinging after this works, so we are good to go.
